              Abstract <br />
              
              This paper explores the success of scaling up of state programs. I exploit the two phases of staggered rollout of the 
              AP Incentives Programs in Texas which aim to increase AP utilization. The 1997 pilot phase included a small group of 
              high schools, the main phased expanded this to half of all Texas high schools in 2001. Using a staggered difference in 
              difference approach, I separately estimate the impact of the program in each phase. I find an 70% increase in AP 
              Enrollment and 40% increase in the number of AP courses for the schools which implemented the program before scaling 
              up and null effect for the schools which implemented the program after scaling up. The difference also exists for the 
              college outcomes and labor outcomes suggestively. I also find evidence consistent with the potential driver is student 
              demand for the AP courses.

              Private Test Preparation Schools (TPSs), which are not manda- tory but helpful for students who prepare for the 
              University Entrance Exam, were shut down in Turkey. They were allowed to reopen as private schools. This paper analyze 
              the effect of the closure of TPSs on public and private school markets. By using the distance to the nearest 
              formerly-existed TPS as the treatment intensity I show that there is an increase in the number pf private schools, 
              the nearest pub- lic schools to a TPS lost almost two classroom size students to the converted private schools and the 
              loss come from the students who are in their junior and senior years, closer to the University Entrance Exam.
